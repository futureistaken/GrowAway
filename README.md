This app will recommend plants to users and allow users to identify the ideal plants for their lifestyle.

The user will set parameters like season, size of the garden, and low/medium/high maintenance through touch gestures like swiping and tapping. The app will then suggest plants to the users, and provide images of the plant. The app can also be programmed to remind the user to water their plants
with push notifications! it also could get connected to weather stations to prevent the water waste by alarming the user about the rainy days.
